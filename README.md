## Special Shoutout to My Design Journey! 🎨

All the designs you see here (including my cute face!) were created with Procreate on iPad. While I'm not a professional designer, I did my best to make Brainy look friendly and approachable. If you're a designer and would like to help improve Brainy's look or the overall app design, I'd love to collaborate! Feel free to reach out using any of the contact methods.

_Note: I intentionally chose not to use AI for Brainy's design out of deep respect for the incredible work of human designers. While AI can create amazing designs, I believe in supporting the unique creativity and expertise of human designers 🎨_
